## Scaling with Confidence: How Blackline Enabled Rapid Expansion

American Alliance Casualty Company (AACC), a fast-growing provider of affordable auto insurance, partners with a nationwide network of independent agents to serve policyholders across the U.S. What began as a 15-person team rapidly expanded to nearly 100 employees. But as the business grew, their IT infrastructure failed to scale with them—leading to costly inefficiencies, recurring outages, and increasing compliance risk.

### **The Problem**

Before partnering with Blackline, AACC was reliant on a legacy outsourced IT provider that was never designed to support a high-growth insurance organization. As AACC scaled, they began facing persistent technology setbacks that impacted every corner of the business—from executive oversight to agent-facing operations.

Their systems were over-engineered and under-documented, leaving the company with infrastructure that was fragile, unscalable, and out of compliance with emerging regulations. Communication tools were outdated and support was reactive at best—fueling internal frustration and operational risk.

**Risks Identified:**

- **System instability and lack of redundancy**, threatening business continuity
- **Gaps in cybersecurity and compliance**, exposing the business to potential regulatory violations
- **Adversarial, reactive IT vendor**, misaligned with AACC’s strategic goals
- **Legacy telecom systems**, hindering both internal and external communications

**What brought Blackline to the table** was AACC’s realization that continued growth required more than just IT support—they needed a technology partner that could build stability, improve governance, and deliver strategic guidance at scale.

### **How We Solved It**

Blackline initiated the engagement with AACC through our proprietary **AIM process**, laying the groundwork for a structured plan to elevate their IT infrastructure. We pursued an economically strategic path by **leveraging technology assets AACC had already acquired**, while simultaneously delivering ongoing **strategic advisory services**. Over the years, we have partnered with them to **plan, design, and implement** new technologies that are carefully aligned with their operational goals and budget constraints.

To support AACC’s growth trajectory, Black Line also assumed responsibility for critical **IT Management functions**, which included:

- Help desk services and user support
    
- Service level agreement (SLA) governance
    
- Asset management
    
- Budget planning and forecasting
    
- Implementation of compliance-focused **IT policies, procedures, and technologies**
    

These initiatives collectively brought AACC into alignment with relevant **regulatory and compliance standards**. In addition, we delivered a range of tailored solutions to support evolving organizational needs, including:

- Managing the relocation of their corporate offices
    
- Taking over and optimizing their **telephony systems**
    
- Rolling out **continuous security awareness training** for end-users
    
- Hosting and maintaining their **public-facing website**
    

### **The Outcome**

The results were transformative. AACC now operates on a secure, scalable, and modern IT foundation built for long-term growth. With Blackline, they gained the confidence to expand operations without worrying whether their technology could keep up.  

### Reduced infrastructure downtime, boosting daily productivity.

### Improved help desk response, backed by SLA-driven service delivery.

### Achieved regulatory compliance, modernized communications infrastructure.

### **Value Delivered**

Blackline didn’t just resolve technical issues—we enabled AACC to align their technology with their business growth trajectory. By providing structure, stability, and foresight, we turned their IT function into a proactive engine for performance, compliance, and operational clarity.

Through our partnership, AACC now operates with:

- **Confidence in compliance and security posture**
- **Scalable systems that evolve with business needs**
- **Clarity around IT budgeting, governance, and lifecycle planning**
- **Technology as a strategic differentiator**, not just a utility

Blackline transformed AACC’s fragile, outdated IT environment into a secure, scalable foundation that supports their rapid growth. By modernizing infrastructure, improving compliance, and introducing proactive support, we turned IT from a liability into a strategic asset—reducing downtime by 90% and enabling seamless expansion to nearly 100 employees.

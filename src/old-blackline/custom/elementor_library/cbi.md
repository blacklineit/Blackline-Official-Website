## Doubled E-Commerce Revenue Through Tech Modernization

Craig Bachman Imports (CBI), a nationally recognized wholesale distributor of craft and seasonal décor, relies heavily on technology to support warehousing, distribution, ERP operations, and online sales. With 75–100 employees and locations in multiple states, the business requires consistent uptime—especially during seasonal peaks when operational continuity is essential.

But CBI found itself constrained by unstable systems, misaligned ERP tools, and a fractured internal IT team. Recurring outages, mounting inefficiencies, and stalled digital growth became impossible to ignore—threatening the company’s ability to scale.

### **The Problem**

Before partnering with Blackline, CBI faced major challenges across its IT landscape. Frequent infrastructure failures and unplanned downtime were disrupting business operations—particularly during high-demand cycles. Their ERP system was not only misaligned with business workflows, but also contributed to delays and process confusion across departments.

Internally, the situation was equally strained. High IT staff turnover led to inconsistent management, poor documentation, and loss of institutional knowledge. There were few guardrails in place, and best practices around backup, security, and system monitoring had fallen by the wayside.

**Risks Identified:**

- System instability jeopardizing day-to-day operations and peak season fulfillment
- Lack of infrastructure hygiene introducing security vulnerabilities
- Minimal internal capacity to manage or optimize critical IT assets
- Underperforming ERP system causing departmental bottlenecks and inefficiency

**What brought Blackline to the table** was CBI’s realization that they needed more than just a fix—they needed a strategic partner who could stabilize operations, align technology to business needs, and position them for digital growth.

### **How We Solved It**

Blackline took full ownership of CBI’s IT environment, becoming their strategic partner across all dimensions of technology. We began by stabilizing core infrastructure—resolving long-standing reliability issues, implementing standard patching and backup processes, and rolling out proactive system monitoring to ensure uptime.

Next, we addressed the ERP—streamlining its configuration, optimizing workflows, and turning it from a liability into a business enabler. On the digital side, we rebuilt CBI’s e-commerce platform to align with backend systems and modern customer expectations, delivering a faster, more reliable, and more conversion-friendly experience.

We also upgraded the Dallas location, enhancing IT reliability in the warehouse, tradeshow, and distribution environments.

### **The Outcome**

The results were both immediate and sustained. Blackline delivered a reliable, modern IT environment that scaled effortlessly during peak seasons—and empowered CBI to embrace new digital opportunities with confidence. By transforming unreliable tech into a strategic advantage, CBI unlocked capacity, reduced risk, and positioned itself for sustained growth.

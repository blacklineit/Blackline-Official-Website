Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms and models that allow computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time. It plays a crucial role in enabling AI systems to recognize patterns, make predictions, and adapt to new information.

There are generally two types of AI: Narrow or Weak AI, which is designed to perform specific tasks, and General or Strong AI, which possesses human-level intelligence and can handle a wide range of tasks.

AI has applications in various fields, including:

- Natural Language Processing (NLP) for chatbots, language translation, and sentiment analysis.
- Computer Vision for image recognition, object detection, and autonomous vehicles.
- Machine Learning for predictive analytics, data mining, and pattern recognition.
- Robotics for automation in industries such as manufacturing and healthcare.
- AI-powered personal assistants, recommendation systems, and fraud detection, among others.

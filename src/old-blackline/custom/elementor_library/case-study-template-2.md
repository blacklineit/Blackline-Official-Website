Strategic Infrastructure Overhaul and ERP Optimization Drive 100% Sales Growth

When Craig Bachman Imports (CBI), a premier craft supply wholesaler, faced escalating system outages and a 40% annual revenue growth bottleneck, Blackline executed a 12-month digital transformation initiative. By stabilizing infrastructure, optimizing their ERP system, and relaunching their e-commerce platform with AI-driven inventory tools, CBI achieved **99.99% uptime** and **$8.5M in annual online sales**—a 100% increase from pre-engagement levels.

#### **The Challenge**

CBI's aging IT infrastructure suffered from pervasive instability issues and significant deviations from industry best practices, resulting in frequent and costly business disruptions that impacted both employee productivity and customer satisfaction. The company's technical foundation had deteriorated following multiple transitions within their internal IT leadership, creating knowledge gaps and inconsistent system maintenance. This volatile situation necessitated engaging an experienced outsourced provider who could not only stabilize their existing infrastructure but also implement proper management protocols and documentation standards. Their enterprise resource planning (ERP) system emerged as a particularly problematic area, exhibiting performance issues and lacking critical functionality needed for modern business operations. Additionally, their legacy e-commerce platform had fallen behind current technology standards and was struggling to handle increasing transaction volumes, creating a significant bottleneck for their ambitious online sales growth targets.

#### **The Solution**

Black Line IT initiated their engagement by deploying their proprietary **AIM (Agility, Innovation, Maturity) process**, a comprehensive assessment methodology that systematically identified numerous critical risks and vulnerabilities that had previously gone undetected during Craig Bachman Imports' prior IT management. Through this detailed diagnostic approach, Black Line was able to develop and execute a strategic roadmap of targeted solutions designed to fundamentally stabilize the infrastructure, dramatically enhance system reliability, and create a robust foundation for sustainable business growth. The implementation strategy encompassed several key initiatives, beginning with thorough **risk reduction** measures, where Black Line's team methodically analyzed potential failure points and swiftly implemented preventative recommendations to effectively mitigate operational disruptions and ensure consistent business continuity across all systems. In parallel, they orchestrated comprehensive **hardware and software upgrades** throughout the organization, carefully selecting and implementing modern solutions to significantly enhance system performance and reliability, thereby ensuring that CBI's technology infrastructure could readily accommodate their current operational demands while maintaining sufficient capacity for future expansion. A critical component of the transformation involved Black Line assuming complete oversight of **ERP management**, where they thoroughly restructured and optimized the enterprise resource planning system that had previously been a significant source of operational inefficiency for CBI, implementing new features and streamlining existing processes to maximize productivity. Perhaps most significantly, they undertook a complete **modernization of the e-commerce platform**, incorporating advanced scalability features, implementing robust security measures, and integrating intelligent inventory management systems to effectively handle increased customer traffic and growing sales volumes while maintaining optimal performance. This carefully orchestrated strategic overhaul established a solid technological foundation that positioned CBI for sustained long-term growth while simultaneously enhancing their ability to deliver superior customer engagement and satisfaction.

#### **Results and Impact**

The partnership between Craig Bachman Imports and Black Line IT yielded impressive results, showcasing the transformative impact of strategic IT management. Notably, Black Line consistently maintained a **95% response and resolution rate** for IT issues, ensuring that all problems were addressed within an average of 45 minutes. This rapid response significantly reduced downtime and enhanced operational efficiency. Additionally, the infrastructure overhaul achieved **99.98-99.99% uptime** for systems, servers, and internet, providing a stable foundation for business operations. The Dallas location, once a problematic site, was transformed into a stellar performer following a comprehensive upgrade, contributing to improved overall business performance. Perhaps most notably, the modernization of CBI’s e-commerce platform led to a **doubling of online sales** in early 2020, with sustained growth continuing to this day. This dramatic increase in e-commerce revenue underscored the success of Black Line’s tailored solutions in driving business expansion and profitability.

#### Advanced Cyber Protection Simplified

Threat Down (formerly Malwarebytes) is a proactive cybersecurity solution designed specifically for small and mid-sized businesses, providing advanced detection, rapid response, and comprehensive protection against malware, ransomware, phishing attacks, and emerging cyber threats.

### Why Choose Threat Down?

### Eliminate Technology Pain Points

Businesses today face escalating cyber threats coupled with a fragmented approach to security, often resulting in severe operational disruptions and financial losses. In fact, 43% of cyber attacks target SMBs, and a single ransomware attack can cost a business an average of $159,000 (Datto, 2023). Threat Down directly addresses these vulnerabilities by providing unified, strategic protection—transforming cybersecurity from a business risk into a competitive advantage.

Leveraging artificial intelligence, Graphus provides real-time protection, reducing risk and ensuring business continuity without complex management requirements.

### Why Choose Graphus?

#### **Pain Points Graphus Solves**

Cyber threats are escalating rapidly, and small to mid-sized businesses often lack the resources for extensive cybersecurity teams. Traditional email security tools struggle to detect sophisticated phishing attacks, leaving companies vulnerable.

#### **Did you know?**

Graphus addresses these critical gaps by automating threat detection and response, providing businesses with robust email protection without the need for costly infrastructure or specialized staff.

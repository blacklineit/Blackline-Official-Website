**Why Choose Datto Networking?**

**Solving Real Business Challenges:** Small to mid-sized businesses often struggle with network downtime, which directly impacts productivity and revenue. Datto Networking directly addresses this critical pain point by proactively monitoring and preventing issues before they disrupt operations. A single hour of downtime can cost small businesses an average of $8,000 (Source: Datto’s State of the Channel Ransomware Report, 2020). Datto Networking ensures businesses stay continuously operational, protecting their bottom line and enabling teams to focus on growth rather than troubleshooting technology.

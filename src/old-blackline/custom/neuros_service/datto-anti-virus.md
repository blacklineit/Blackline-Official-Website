### Pain Points Datto Antivirus Solves

Businesses today are increasingly vulnerable to cyberattacks, with small and mid-sized businesses often lacking the resources to defend against sophisticated threats. Traditional antivirus solutions can miss up to 60% of emerging malware threats, leaving companies exposed to costly breaches (Ponemon Institute, 2023). Datto Antivirus closes this gap by delivering enterprise-level security tailored specifically for SMB needs, enabling you to confidently safeguard your assets without extensive in-house resources.

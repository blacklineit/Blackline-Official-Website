## Can you measure the value from your technology investments, or just an anecdotal feeling? 

In many organizations, technology decisions are made with the best of intentions—new systems are introduced to streamline operations, improve productivity, or reduce risk. But months (or years) later, leadership often finds itself asking:

> “What did we actually get out of that investment?”

The answer isn’t always clear.

Despite all the dashboards and reporting tools available today, **many businesses still rely on anecdotal evidence to assess the effectiveness of their technology investments**. “It feels like it’s working” isn’t enough in today’s economy—especially when budgets are under scrutiny, and technology is deeply integrated into the fabric of operations.

So how do you go beyond instinct and actually **measure the value of your technology**?

## **The Business Case: Why This Question Matters**

### **Tech Spend Is Up—But Confidence Is Down**

According to Blackline’s internal research and industry analysis:

- **81% of company leaders** report they are not achieving their technology goals.
- **67% of financial leaders** believe their recent tech purchases have underperformed.

This signals a critical gap: **Organizations are investing in technology without a clear framework for evaluating its business impact**.

It’s not just a missed ROI—it’s a risk to strategic agility, budget planning, and stakeholder trust.

### **Shifting Expectations for Tech Investments**

In the past, IT was viewed largely as a cost center—responsible for infrastructure, security, and support. Today, that role has changed dramatically.

Modern organizations expect technology to:

- **Enable innovation**
- **Support strategic goals**
- **Improve customer and employee experience**
- **Generate measurable outcomes**

This evolution demands a more disciplined, evidence-based approach to evaluating performance.

## **Framework for Measurement: From Gut Feel to Strategic Insight**

### **Operationalizing ROI: The Role of Strategic Alignment**

One way organizations are bridging the value gap is by shifting focus from outputs (e.g., uptime, feature rollouts) to **outcomes** (e.g., revenue impact, cost avoidance, process efficiency).

This requires connecting every technology initiative back to:

- A **business goal**
- A set of **performance indicators**
- A timeframe for **evaluation**

Without these anchors, organizations fall back on assumptions and anecdotes—which are rarely sufficient for decision-making.

### **A Model for Measurement: Blackline’s Apex Innovation Model (AIM)**

To bring structure to this process, Blackline developed the **Apex Innovation Model (AIM)**. AIM is not a product, but a **framework for aligning technology decisions with strategic outcomes**. It helps organizations:

- Conduct deep discovery to define business priorities
- Map technology initiatives to those goals
- Identify leading and lagging indicators
- Track value over time—not just at implementation

The value of a model like AIM lies in its ability to create **repeatability and transparency** in how decisions are made and evaluated.

## **Key Challenges Organizations Face When Measuring Tech Value**

Many companies struggle with technology measurement for reasons that are systemic, not technical. Here are some of the most common barriers:

### **1\. Vague or Undefined Success Metrics**

Without clear benchmarks, it's difficult to know if a solution is performing. For example, what does "better collaboration" or "improved security" actually mean in measurable terms?

**What helps:** Establishing specific KPIs—such as reduction in ticket volumes, response time improvements, user adoption rates, or revenue per employee.

### **2\. Technology Decisions Made in Isolation**

When IT and business units are misaligned, technology becomes a siloed function rather than an integrated enabler. This disconnect often results in solutions that don’t move the needle.

**What helps:** Embedding IT in strategic planning cycles and co-owning goals between functional and technical teams.

### **3\. Lack of Follow-Through After Implementation**

In many organizations, the measurement phase ends when the system goes live. But the real value of technology emerges in how it's used, adopted, and improved over time.

**What helps:** Quarterly or bi-annual reviews focused on ROI, adoption trends, and whether the original business goals are being met.

## **The Value of Measuring Technology Investments**

Organizations that measure the business value of their tech investments see both **quantifiable** and **qualitative** benefits:

### **Tangible Benefits**

- **Cost reductions** through automation, consolidation, or efficiency gains
- **Improved productivity** via reduced rework or time spent on manual tasks
- **Risk reduction** from better compliance, security, or resilience

### **Intangible Gains**

- **Executive clarity** around what’s working and what isn’t
- **Employee alignment** when they understand the ‘why’ behind the tech
- **Cultural shifts** toward innovation and accountability

These aren’t just theoretical advantages—they’re critical for maintaining competitive momentum.

## **How to Start Measuring Tech Value in Your Organization**

Not sure where to begin? Here’s a pragmatic starting point.

### **Step 1: Inventory Your Technology**

Start with a **basic catalog of your tools**. What systems do you use? Who owns them? What were they intended to accomplish?

### **Step 2: Define Expected Outcomes**

For each major system, define:

- The problem it was meant to solve
- The process it was meant to improve
- The outcomes you hoped to achieve

### **Step 3: Establish Metrics That Matter**

Avoid vanity metrics. Focus instead on:

- Time saved
- Cost avoided
- Uptime gained
- Satisfaction improved

And make sure those metrics can be captured with available tools or processes.

### **Step 4: Monitor and Adapt**

Measurement isn’t a one-time event. Implement **review cycles** that revisit goals, track progress, and adapt tactics. This is where models like AIM can add discipline to an otherwise ad hoc process.

## **Final Thoughts: From Anecdotes to Accountability**

It’s not that gut instinct is always wrong—it’s just incomplete.

In a landscape where technology is expected to drive business growth, **organizations need more than anecdotes to guide decisions**. They need frameworks, indicators, and a shared understanding of success.

By making measurement a core part of your technology lifecycle, you’re not just proving ROI—you’re making better, faster, and more strategic decisions.

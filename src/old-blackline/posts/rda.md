From Fragmented to Frictionless: Powering Expansion Through IT Integration

Raynor Door Authority (RDA) is a North American leader in residential and commercial garage door solutions. Operating across 12 locations with over 150 employees—including 89 field technicians—RDA’s business model is built on two pillars: aggressive acquisition and ERP-driven operational excellence. As their footprint grew, however, fragmented systems and inconsistent IT operations became a barrier to their strategic expansion.

### **The Problem**

RDA’s rapid growth exposed the limitations of their disjointed IT environment. Each newly acquired branch operated on its own infrastructure, leading to siloed data, delayed integration timelines, and a growing mismatch between business needs and technological capability.

The downstream impact was severe:

- **Inventory inaccuracies** across branches created delays in order fulfillment and customer dissatisfaction
- **ERP implementation struggles**, compounded by inconsistent data quality and poor system interoperability
- **Field tech inefficiencies**, with outdated tablets causing more than **3 hours of lost productivity per week per technician**
- **Sales enablement gaps**, as reps lacked real-time access to inventory and customer data
- **$500,000+ in annual opportunity loss**, driven by integration delays, inefficient vendor coordination, and disconnected systems

The cost of inaction became too high. RDA needed a true strategic partner—not just an IT vendor—to architect a technology foundation capable of scaling with their ambitions.

### **Risks Identified:**

- **Inventory discrepancies** across locations, leading to delayed order fulfillment and customer dissatisfaction
    
- **Siloed infrastructure**, making post-acquisition system integration slow, inconsistent, and expensive
    
- **ERP delays and downtime**, caused by incompatible systems and lack of standardized processes
    
- **Field technician inefficiencies**, resulting in over 3 hours of weekly lost productivity per tech
    
- **Sales limitations**, with reps unable to access real-time data, impacting close rates and customer responsiveness
    
- **Inconsistent device performance**, increasing turnover and contributing to operational frustration
    
- **Vendor misalignment**, creating integration delays and costing the business over **$500,000 annually** in missed opportunities and inefficiencies
    

**ERP Integration & System Unification**

Blackline orchestrated a seamless bridge between acquired companies and the SAP ERP core. By developing custom APIs and centralizing system architecture, we enabled real-time inventory sync, order accuracy, and visibility across all 12 locations.

**Field Operations Modernization**

We equipped every technician with **military-grade rugged tablets**, optimized for durability and connectivity in variable field environments. The outcome: a **15% drop in service resolution time** and a **22% reduction in technician turnover**, thanks to smoother workflows and fewer tech-related frustrations.

**Back Office Acceleration**

With SSD upgrades and hardware standardization, office staff experienced **40% faster system performance**, reducing ERP latency and empowering quicker decision-making.

**Marketing Transformation**

Integrated ERP-CRM data streams unlocked highly personalized customer engagement strategies. Marketing campaigns became smarter, more timely, and more relevant—contributing to a **25% lift in qualified leads** and an **18% increase in cross-sell conversions**.

### **The Outcome**

The results of the TQ Framework transformation were substantial—and measurable:

- **ERP downtime reduced to 0.1%**, ensuring business continuity
- **Acquisition onboarding reduced from 3 months to 2 weeks**, boosting time-to-value
- **Field tech productivity increased 30%**, reclaiming thousands of hours annually
- **Revenue grew 8x since 2017**, supported by scalable infrastructure
- **Marketing-led lead generation jumped 25%**, driven by integrated customer insights

### **Value Delivered**

Blackline didn’t just fix problems—we built a **scalable, acquisition-ready tech foundation** that turned RDA’s IT from a liability into a growth engine.

- **One Ecosystem Strategy** eliminated over **$2 million in annual inefficiencies**
- **Pre-built integration playbooks** cut post-acquisition IT costs by **50%**
- **User-centric upgrades** improved both performance and retention

Blackline’s partnership with Raynor Door Authority transformed IT from a fragmented, reactive necessity into a fully aligned growth enabler. By unifying infrastructure, modernizing field technology, accelerating ERP performance, and integrating marketing systems, we delivered a cohesive technology foundation that scales with the business. The result was faster acquisitions, increased productivity across all departments, and a measurable return on investment—culminating in 8x revenue growth and over $2 million in annual operational savings. Today, RDA no longer views IT as a support function but as a strategic pillar fueling innovation, efficiency, and long-term expansion.

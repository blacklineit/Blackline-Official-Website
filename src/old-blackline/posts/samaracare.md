A ‘life changing’ IT experience to an organization that was vastly underserved

SamaraCare Counseling, a nonprofit mental health provider, delivers affordable counseling services to a diverse community. With 50 end users across multiple office locations, their ability to deliver care depends on consistent, secure, and compliant IT operations. Unfortunately, their previous IT partner left them struggling with persistent outages, compliance vulnerabilities, and a reactive support model that disrupted clinical workflows and caused operational burnout.

### **The Problem**

Before Blackline, SamaraCare’s IT environment was defined by instability and underperformance. Staff were routinely pulled away from patient-focused work to troubleshoot tech issues, while leadership faced growing concerns around HIPAA compliance, data protection, and the scalability of their infrastructure.

Their existing IT partner was unresponsive, slow to resolve issues, and delivered only surface-level fixes. Systemic problems—especially around backups, inter-office connectivity, and internet outages—remained unresolved, putting both operations and patient data at risk.

**Risks Identified:**

- Unreliable backups and server outages jeopardizing data integrity and continuity of care
- Repeated service interruptions across offices, impacting staff and patients
- Misalignment with HIPAA compliance requirements, exposing the organization to regulatory risk
- Internal burnout, as administrative staff worked overtime to compensate for poor IT support

**What brought Blackline to the table** was SamaraCare’s critical need for a true technology partner who could stabilize their IT operations, secure sensitive health information, and create a foundation for future growth—without disrupting care delivery.

### **Our Approach to the Problem**

We launched with a deep-dive **Apex Innovator Model (AIM)** evaluation to assess their entire IT ecosystem—mapping infrastructure, workflows, compliance gaps, and day-to-day challenges from the lens of their mission-critical outcomes.

Our **goal** was clear: to stabilize operations, ensure HIPAA readiness, modernize infrastructure, and reframe technology from an operational burden into an enabler of care.

We encountered several **obstacles** to that goal:

- A highly fragmented support environment with no root-cause tracking
- Disparate infrastructure across locations causing inconsistency and downtime
- Backups misaligned with user behavior (e.g., clinicians working overnight)
- Limited guidance on EHR transitions and long-term compliance planning

Our roadmap included immediate issue remediation, strategic standardization across locations, modernization of backup and connectivity systems, and direct support for EHR and compliance initiatives.

> **“**Our entire staff located in multiple locations are all raving about the excellent support from Blackline. They have made our frustrations with IT a thing of the past.**”**

> — Director of Finance and Administration, SamaraCare Counseling

### **How We Solved It**

Blackline became SamaraCare’s strategic partner, quickly transforming their IT posture from reactive to resilient. We started by resolving long-standing infrastructure issues, standardizing connectivity between offices, and installing a reliable, up-to-date server environment.

We overhauled their backup system to ensure daily protection so no data would ever be lost, regardless of working hours. Blackline also coordinated the technical evaluation and launch support for SamaraCare’s new Electronic Health Record (EHR) platform, ensuring the implementation aligned with their workflows and compliance needs.

### **The Outcome**

SamaraCare’s transformation was immediate and meaningful. Their operations are now stable, secure, and scalable—freeing staff to focus entirely on care delivery. Blackline’s strategic alignment with their mission delivered tangible improvements in performance, user experience, and compliance confidence.

- **99.7% response rate** within SLA Standards
- **94.7% resolution rate** within SLA SLA Standards
- Eliminated end user friction which was considered “life changing” by one of their directors
- Seamless support and rollout of **new EHR software**, with minimal disruption

### **Value Delivered**

Blackline didn’t just fix technology—we helped SamaraCare align technology with their purpose. Through strategic implementation and ongoing AIM-led support, they now operate with:

- **Peace of mind** around data protection and compliance
- **Consistent connectivity** and productivity across office locations
- **Operational efficiency** that eliminates overtime and burnout
- **Technology as a strategic asset**, not a liability

The partnership proves that well-managed technology empowers healthcare delivery. SamaraCare now focuses purely on their core mission: providing mental health support to their community, backed by reliable IT infrastructure.

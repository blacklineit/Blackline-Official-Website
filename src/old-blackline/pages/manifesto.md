## I.T. is Broken

The IT industry, as it stands today, has fundamentally failed the modern organization.

Instead of being a driver of growth, efficiency, and competitive advantage, IT has become a burden—one that is riddled with **deception**, **dependency**, **broken promises, misalignment, and waste.**

Organizations rely on technology to compete in a digital world, but find themselves trapped in **an ecosystem that benefits vendors and providers far more than it benefits them.**

## **Why is I.T. Broken?**

What is this ecosystem you are trapped in?  You are an unwilling participant in the **“Tech Industrial Complex” or TIC.**  A coalition of companies, systems and people that functions much like a casino, where the **house always wins**—where you continue to pour money in, while the **TIC profits from your confusion, dependency, and frustration.**

Organizations find themselves locked into a rigged game where breaking free is costly and difficult.

You are not a player in their casino, you are the mark.

## **What is Painfully Obvious?**

**The TIC is not working for the good of the modern organization.**

**a**. Pushing misaligned, over-engineered, and unnecessary solutions to meet sales quotas, and achieve internal revenue goals; **focusing on their bottom line over your success.**

**b.** Grand promises, long-term reliance on expensive and irreplaceable solutions, trapping you in cycles of overcharging, underperformance, and increased operational risk; **knowing that leaving their ecosystem is financially or operationally devastating.**

**c.** Large competency gaps, **lacking the necessary expertise, judgment, honesty, or accountability** to provide strategic technology guidance.

**d.** Overwhelming technology options; creating decision fatigue, making it nearly **impossible to make** **well-informed, strategic choices.**

**e.** Techno-Arrogance, intimidation, manipulation, technical jargon, misdirection, elitism, and dismissiveness to maintain control over decision-making; **to** **provide vague performance metrics and deliver obscure, poor results**.

**f.** Legal traps, restrictive contracts; locking you into long-term commitments; **even though their solutions are failing you.**

**There is a massive “Tech Value Gap”, the disconnect between what you invest in technology and the value you receive.**

### **Why is technology so hard for the SME?**

Where do you start? Who do you trust? How do you know what's really going on with your technology? What best practices do you really need?

**The questions are simple, the answers frustratingly complex.**

Note that the Site is hosted in the United States; if you access it from another region with different data protection laws, you consent to your data being transferred to and processed in the United States.

## 11\. Term and Termination

These Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect as long as you use the Site. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion and without notice or liability, to deny access to or use of the Site (including blocking certain IP addresses) for any reason, including for breaches of these Terms of Use or applicable law.

## 13\. Governing Law

These Terms of Use and your use of the Site are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois, without regard to its conflict of law principles.

## 14\. Dispute Resolution

### Informal Negotiations

To expedite resolution and reduce costs, both parties agree to attempt to negotiate any dispute (“Dispute”) informally for at least 30 days prior to initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one party to the other.

### Binding Arbitration

If the parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those expressly excluded) will be exclusively resolved via binding arbitration under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") (and the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes, where applicable). Arbitration fees and arbitrator compensation will be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be conducted in person, by phone, or online, and the arbitrator’s decision will be in writing. Except as otherwise required, the arbitration will take place in Illinois.

If a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, it shall be brought in the state and federal courts located in Illinois, and the parties consent to personal jurisdiction in such courts. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and UCITA are excluded from these Terms.

In no event shall any Dispute be commenced more than one (1) year after the cause of action arose. If any portion of this arbitration provision is found unlawful or unenforceable, then that portion shall be severed and the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.

**Restrictions:** Any arbitration shall be limited to the dispute between the parties individually. No arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding, nor may any dispute be arbitrated on a class‑action basis.

**Exceptions:** The following disputes are excluded from informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) disputes regarding the enforcement or validity of any intellectual property rights; (b) disputes related to allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief.

YOUR LIABILITY, IF ANY, SHALL AT ALL TIMES BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID, IF ANY, BY YOU TO US DURING THE SIX (6) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE CAUSE OF ACTION.

## 18\. Indemnification

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us harmless—along with our subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, partners, and employees—from and against any loss, damage, liability, claim, or demand (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) arising out of: (1) your use of the Site; (2) any breach of these Terms of Use; (3) any breach of your representations and warranties herein; (4) your violation of the rights of any third party; or (5) any harmful act directed toward any other user of the Site.
